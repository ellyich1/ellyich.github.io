                    data-size="60 × 80 cm" data-date="December 2019" data-description="This piece is hugely inspired by a Chinese artist named Hu Yong Kai (胡永凯). His artworks portray
                    the Chinese culture (rural scenery and snapshots of everyday life) and a stylised facial expression –
                    the rectangular nose, long ears, almond shape eyes, heart-shaped mouth, and a thick line of
                    eyebrows. Since I am staying in China, I intend to learn more about its beautiful culture. I aim to
                    recreate a modern Chinese stylisation using Hu’s technique, illustrating a Chinese woman sitting in
                    the living room with a tea set.">

                    choose to focus on a relationship I had that have influenced me in both positive and negative ways.
                    In the process of loving this person, I have dealt with many toxicity behaviours that left me
                    completely broken yet, I have also experienced the rawest emotions of what it is to bond with
                    someone on the deepest level – love, learn, and trust. Despite the pain it brought me, I am still
                    grateful for what everything that happened.">

                    express my perspective on the journey to find what my own identity means to me. Despite my
                    awareness of the people that shaped my identity, there are still numerous underlying factors that
                    contribute to my individuality. Therefore, the process of understanding oneself is endless, almost
                    mysterious like the forest – an unexplored realm full of the unknown.">

                    vision I had of how fragile the line between living and dying is. No one can predict what tomorrow
                    will hold, so we must treasure the present time and live our life to the fullest. I hope everyone that
                    sees this will take a moment to reflect and appreciate their life and surroundings.">

                    One of her works Group IV, no. 2, the Ten Largest, Youth, portrays a picture of life from her
                    perspective – birth and growth. Similarly, I intend to take a Japanese cultural symbol/pattern called
                    “kikkou” to create geometric abstract art and convey my perception of what life means. Since the
                    “kikkou” represents longevity, I wanted to use this pattern to showcase the beauty and sorrow of
                    one’s life.

                    showing a giant hand holding a woman because I want to emphasise nature’s creation – a gift. The
                    plants hanging from those palms are a representation of nature’s hand. From my perspective,
                    women are one of the most vulnerable yet the strongest people that must be protected and valued.
                    Therefore, by placing a woman in the gentle palm, the audience can understand that all women are
                    precious. ">

                    honour our parents, especially our mother. My mom is one of the best role models because she is a
                    strong and respectable woman. She plays a huge role in influencing who I am as a person, hence my
                    identity. Since November is a Thanksgiving month, I felt that it is the right time to pay my respects
